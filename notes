# Runs data
run1 - two laps clockwise and two laps counterclockwise
run2 - recorded recovery lap with extra tries around turns with no lane lines on left/right; also recorded recovery from edge of lane to center multiple times
run3 - recorded recover lap with extra tries around bridge; also recorded recovery from edge of lane to center lane many times
run4 - recorded taking turns with no lanes; seems to screw up model predictions; going to avoid using this dataset
run5 -
run6 - skipped
run7 - two laps clockwise with mostly mouse steering
run8 - recorded recovery lap; recovery from edge of lane to center multiple times; steering with mouse
run9 -
run10 - recorded smooth lap clockwise and counterclockwise; using mouse steering
run11 - recorded smooth laps clockwise and counterclokwise around track 2

Will retry training with stronger regularization

TODO:
* Experiment with steering_correction parameter
* Try different sampling strategies from different runs (maybe using probablities)
* Need to try filtering out data within 0.15 to -0.15 steering angle etc.
* Also need to figure out data collection for track 2.
